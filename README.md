Markdown-Pandoc Template
========================

This is a *very* simple Markdown-Pandoc template for some
simple documentation. The source files are separated into
the `src` directory, where a user can work on documentation.
Integration with `make` allows easy compilation to html. 

Note: This template uses Twitter Bootstrap for the CSS
